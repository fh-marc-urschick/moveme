# Move me

It is an application which provide the ability to manage the movement of people and companies to a different location
inside a town, to different towns or even countries.

## Editor Config

Our general code guidelines contain a standardized charset of ```UTF-8``` and ```LF``` as new line character for compatibility across all general platforms. Furthermore, we introduced 4 spaces for indentation as well as no tabs.

## PMD

We use PMD to check against bad code practices. A custom ruleset is used. As a starting point we only used the rule against unused private fields.
